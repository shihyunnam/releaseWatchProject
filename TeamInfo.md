## Project Summary
ReleaseWatch is a website that allows users to view details about upcoming unreleased video games. When there is a highly-anticipated video game release on the horizon, there is plenty of news floating around the internet, whether it’s leaks from within the development or testing team, new gameplay trailers, official announcements from the publisher, or other miscellaneous details which fans may care about. Our project provides a solution to find all the details about an upcoming release, such as the title, publisher, developer, studio size, price, genre, etc. in one place. Within a game’s release page will be a feed of aggregated information which is submitted by users and verified by moderators. This information can include anything from new in-game images or footage (such as gameplay reveal trailers, or leaks from inside the development/testing team), or miscellaneous updates (let’s say a game has been announced to only come out on one platform), and will be the main selling point of our website. The project aims to provide a convenient solution for those who want to research the latest news about an upcoming video game which they care about, as well as a reputable source to verify rumors or provide a citation source for journalists writing about a release.
